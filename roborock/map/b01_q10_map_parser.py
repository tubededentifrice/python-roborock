"""Parser for Roborock Q10 (B01/ss07) map packets.

Q10 devices deliver map data as a protocol-301 ``MAP_RESPONSE`` message (pushed a
few seconds after a ``dpRequestDps`` request). Unlike the Q7 ``SCMap`` protobuf
format, the Q10 uses a custom, unencrypted binary packet:

- ``01 01`` marker, then a ``u32be`` map id (bytes 2-5) and two consecutive
  ``u16be`` dimensions: grid width (bytes 7-8) and grid height (bytes 9-10).
- A header field at offset 27 (``u16be``) giving the compressed layout length.
- An LZ4-block-compressed occupancy grid starting at offset 29. Once inflated it
  is ``width * height`` cells of grid data followed by room metadata records.
- Room metadata begins with ``01 <room_count>`` followed by fixed 47-byte
  records (id, hints, ascii name). Each room paints cells with value
  ``room_id * 4`` in the grid.

The packet layout was confirmed against live Q10 captures. The format
documentation that informed this clean-room implementation comes from the
``roborock-qseries-map-bridge`` project (GPL-3.0-or-later):
